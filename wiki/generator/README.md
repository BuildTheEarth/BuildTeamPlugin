# BTE Generator

This module lets you generate complex structures using server side scripts.
If used correctly it allows you to speed up your building process by up to 70% and skip boring and repetetive parts of the construction.
Especially in villages where all buildings are rectangle boxes and the roads are very basic it allows you to create entire disticts in no time.
Just by entering a few parameters you can quickly generate a buildings, roads, railways and more.
